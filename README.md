# IW5M-MovieMod
An unfinished moviemaking plugin created for IW5M.

It's fairly basic but useful when creating clips in private match.
It's meant to be hosted on a seperate server, not hosted in your client files directory.
Created in C++ without InfinityScript, only using Nukem's Server Addon. 

Features include a camo/weapon selector, map changer, spawnable and moveable bots, player model changer and some other small bits.

Functions are called in chat, you can type "!help" to see all available commands. Currently support commands are:
!help, !map, !ammo, !perks, !noclip, !3rd, !savepos, !loadpos, !give, !playermodel, !move
